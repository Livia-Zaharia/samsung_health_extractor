#aggregated stress index calculated from heart rate variability and other metrics- composite index rather than raw measurements

.stress.histogram
#histogram distribution of stress levels over time- statistical visualization data derived from stress measurements

.height
#records user's height measurements over time- but since height rarely changes after a certain age, this is essentially a static profile value

.floors_climbed
#floor climbing count using barometric pressure sensor- unreliable metric since floor heights vary significantly by building and region

.report
#contains summary reports generated by Samsung Health app aggregating health metrics over specific periods- essentially processed/analyzed data rather than raw measurements

.tracker.floors_day_summary
#daily aggregated summary of floors climbed- composite data already available from raw floor tracking

#daily activity summary aggregating steps, calories, and active time- composite daily rollup of raw activity measurements

.oxygen_saturation.raw
#raw SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) sensor readings- unprocessed measurement data from the device's pulse oximeter

#.tracker.oxygen_saturation
#processed/aggregated blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements- cleaned and validated readings from continuous tracking

.cycle.preferred
#user preference settings for menstrual cycle tracking- includes configurations like expected cycle length, period duration, fertile window settings- used for app functionality not raw data

.cycle.prediction

.sleep_combined

.skin_temperature

.sleep_stage
